# Clarity Session Review

- **Type:** Session
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
- **Reviewed by:** Claude (self-review — treat with appropriate scepticism)
- **Session scope:** [Brief description of what this session covered]
- **Data sources:** [Git history, conversation context, file inspection — note any limitations]

## What Was Decided

[Plans, approaches, architecture choices made during this session. No jargon. No code. Explain each decision in one or two sentences a non-programmer would understand.]

## What Changed

| File | What it does | What changed | Why |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| [file path] | [One sentence] | [What is different] | [Reason] |

[If files were deleted, list them separately:]

### Deleted files
- [file path]: [one sentence explaining why it was removed]

## Why Those Choices

[If no significant decisions were made, state: "No major architectural or approach decisions were made in this session."]

[Otherwise, for every significant decision:]

**Choice:** [what was chosen]
**Why:** [reasoning]
**Alternatives:** [what else could have been chosen, or "no obvious alternatives"]
**Lock-in:** [Easy to change / Moderate effort to change / Significant commitment — with explanation]

## New Dependencies

[For each new dependency added. If none, state "No new dependencies were added in this session."]

**[Dependency name]** — [what it is in one sentence]. [Why it was added]. [Maintenance status]. [What happens if it breaks].

## Risks and Gaps

[Be direct. Be specific. Use concrete consequences. This is the most important section.]

### Immediate risks
[Things that will cause problems now]

### Future risks
[Things that could become problems as the project grows]

### What was checked and found acceptable
[Important to note what is NOT a concern, so the user knows it was considered]

## Test Coverage

[If tests exist: what they check, what they do not check, how to run them.]
[If no tests: state this and explain what it means in practice.]

## What to Ask Claude Next

[2-3 specific, paste-ready prompts referencing issues found in this review]

- "[Prompt 1]"
- "[Prompt 2]"
- "[Prompt 3]"

## Jargon Buster

| Term | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| [term] | [one-sentence definition] |

## Worth Understanding

[1-2 concepts from this review. Explain why the concept matters, connect it to something in this project, keep it conversational.]
