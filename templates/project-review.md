- **Files scanned:** [n] at summary level
- **Not reviewed:** [areas skipped and why, or "None" if all relevant areas were reviewed]

## What This Project Is

[One paragraph. No jargon. What does it do? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?]

## How It's Built

[Architecture in simple terms. What are the main parts and how do they connect? Think floor plan, not wiring diagram. Use everyday analogies where helpful.]

## What It Depends On

### Core framework
[The main technology the project is built with]

### Libraries and utilities
| Dependency | What it does | Maintenance status | If it breaks |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| [name] | [one sentence] | [Yes, actively / Single maintainer / Uncertain] | [consequence] |

### External services
[APIs, databases, third-party services the project connects to]

## Data and Privacy

[Where does data go? What is stored locally? What is sent externally? Are there API keys or credentials in the code? Is anything sensitive exposed? Be specific.]

## State of Completion

### What works
[Features or components that are functional]

### What is half-built
[Things that are started but incomplete]

### What is missing
[Things that are planned or expected but not yet started]

## Risks and Concerns

[The most important section. Be direct, specific, and consequence-led.]

### Security
[Credential handling, data exposure, authentication, authorisation]

### Fragility
[Single points of failure, missing error handling, things that break easily]

### Test coverage
[What is tested, what is not, what that means in practice]

### Dependency risks
[Dependencies that are unmaintained, single-maintainer, or critical to the project]

### Other concerns
[Anything else a careful reviewer would flag]

## If You Were Handing This to Someone Else

[What would they need to know? What is not obvious from the code? What would trip them up? What decisions need context to understand?]

## What to Ask Claude Next

[2-3 specific, paste-ready prompts referencing issues found in this review]

- "[Prompt 1]"
- "[Prompt 2]"
- "[Prompt 3]"

## Jargon Buster

| Term | What it means |
|------|--------------|

[1-2 concepts from this review. Explain why the concept matters, connect it to something in this project, keep it conversational.]
